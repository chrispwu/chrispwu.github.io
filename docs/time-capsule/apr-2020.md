## April 2020 - Life During COVID-19

So, Bay Area is under lockdown. This's what my working from home life looks like:

### Workdays before sunset:

- Work in pajamas. Send Slack messages and make WebEx calls. Deadlines are coming.
- Stand up every hour to keep my company's Close Your Rings Challenge teammates happy. Perfect month so far!

- Keep my phone away whenever possible since it’s way too distracting.
- Watch my neighbor’s cat doing weird stuff. Oh boy I want one.

### Nights and weekends:

- …keep working or learn stuff in pajamas. Believe it or not, this becomes the #1 leisure activity.
- Cooking! It’s surprisingly fun when my schedule is more flexible.
- Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Most of the time I just do nothing and stare at my avatar laying on the bed (yes this is an Easter themed bed) while listening to the wind blow. So relaxing.

- _Ring_ Fit Adventure, the biggest contributor to my Close Your _Rings_ Challenge score with gyms closed. I feel like I’m the Lord of the _Rings_ now.

- Westworld 3. Bizarrely enough, the real life is becoming as surreal as Westworld. Also catching up on other HBO shows to exploit my annual 2-month HBO Now subscription.
- 微博&[豆瓣哈组](https://www.douban.com/group/638298/). I visited them a lot back in Jan/Feb when the situation in China was grim. Now it’s much better back home while US cases are exploding, so I shifted my iPhone screen time to… ↓
- Reddit, especially [r/Coronavirus](https://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirus/) and, uh, [r/nottheonion](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/), which is almost equivalent to [r/news](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/) recently. What a timeline we're in.
- Great random events, like [One World](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/connect/togetherathome/). The almighty Reddit has a channel: [r/CouchConcerts](https://www.reddit.com/r/CouchConcerts/).
- The Tremendous Federal Daily Live Comedy - “干啥啥不行，甩锅第一名”. Here’s a summary:

- And… started this site. Wow, I haven’t blogged for 7 years and 歪酷 is even defunct now. Hope Github lasts forever!


Clearly I can WFH forever... Lots of things to enjoy at home and the list can easily become much longer. Now, there’re talks about getting back to normal, reopening everything, etc. Let’s see what happens in a month.
