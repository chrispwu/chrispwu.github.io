## "Not a blog"?

So... it's a meme of [GRRM' Blog](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/), where he posts frequently instead of working on The Winds of Winter. I would definitely get a better site name if that book ever got published. Valar morghulis!<br/>

And indeed, this is not a blog.
<br>

## What's in here

### [Tech Notes](/docs/tech-notes)

An index of tech notes, tips and thoughts.

### [Fun](/docs/fun)

At home experiments, leisure stuff.

### [Time Capsule](/docs/time-capsule)

The blog part...
